# Crux Console

To launch development REPL

```sh
yarn install
dev/shadow-dev &
dev/run.sh
```

#### Plotly
Note that Plotly has its own packaging model (due to heavy weight beneath),
so search for different packages on npm if you need more power.
e.g.

- All-in-one https://www.npmjs.com/package/plotly.js-dist
